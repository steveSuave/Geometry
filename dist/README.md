# Geometry

A Javascript Web App for compas and straight edge geometry constructions. Apart from drawing lines and circles, more comlex operations, such as drawing paralel and perpendicular lines, bisection of lines and angles, and drawing a circle defined by three points are available. The user interface supports snaping to lines and circles as well as to intersections of already drawn objects.
